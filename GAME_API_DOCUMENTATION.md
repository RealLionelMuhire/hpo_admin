# Game API Documentation

This document describes the simplified Game MVC system that allows players to participate in card games with a player-centric workflow.

## Game Flow Overview

1. **Create Game**: Frontend creates a game session with only participant count and receives a match_id
2. **Distribute Match ID**: Frontend distributes the match_id to all players  
3. **Individual Player Submission**: Each player submits their win/loss result using the same match_id
4. **Automatic Response Generation**: System automatically generates appropriate responses (winners get explanations, losers get questions)
5. **Frontend Answer Validation**: For losers, frontend validates answers and calls award-points endpoint if correct

**Important Game Logic:**
- **Winners**: Automatically get 1 mark and receive explanation (fun fact) from question model
- **Losers**: Get full question object, frontend validates answer, backend awards mark if correct
- **No "question_answered" or "answer_correct" fields** needed in the submission for winners
- **Simplified workflow** reduces code duplication and clarifies responsibilities

### Post-Game Response Logic

### Winners
- Automatically receive 1 mark
- Get explanation/fun fact from a question related to their context
- No additional action needed

### Losers  
- Receive full question object including `correct_answer`
- Frontend is responsible for answer validation
- If correct answer: frontend calls `/api/games/award-points/` to award 1 mark **and receive explanation**
- If wrong answer: frontend calls `/api/games/record-wrong-answer/` to record failure **and receive explanation**
- **Both correct and incorrect answers return explanations for educational value**

## API Endpoints

All endpoints are **unauthenticated** and use JSON for request/response.

### 1. Create Game
```
POST /api/games/create/
```

**Description**: Create a new game session by specifying only the participant count. The server generates a unique match_id that will be distributed to all players.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
    "participant_count": 4
}
```

**Valid participant counts:** 1, 2, 4, 6
- 1 participant = Player vs Computer (no teams)

## Game Logic

### Teams and Marks
- **1 participant**: 1 team (player vs computer)
- **2+ participants**: 2 teams (split evenly)
- **Winning team members**: Each gets 1 mark
- **Losing team members**: Each gets 0 marks

### Winner Responses
Players on the **winning team** (based on their initial team assignment) receive fun facts from the `explanation` field of questions associated with cards chosen during gameplay.

### Loser Responses  
Players on the **losing team** (based on their initial team assignment) receive questions associated with the cards and must answer them to earn additional points.

### Card Assignment and Response Logic
When a game is completed:
1. Cards are chosen during gameplay (provided in the `cards_chosen` field)
2. **Losing team members** receive questions from the chosen cards
3. **Winning team members** receive fun facts (explanations) from questions associated with the same cards
4. If no specific cards are chosen, random cards are assigned

**Important Response Rules:**
- Team assignment determines response type: **losing team gets questions**, **winning team gets explanations**
- All players return to their **initial assigned teams** for response determination
- Questions contain both the question text (for losers) and explanation text (for winners)
- Winners automatically receive educational content without needing to answer questions

### Player Statistics Tracking
The system automatically tracks comprehensive statistics for each player:

**Game Statistics:**
- `games_played`: Total number of games participated in
- `games_won`: Total number of games won
- `games_lost`: Total number of games lost
- `total_game_marks`: Total marks earned from all games
- `win_rate`: Calculated percentage (games_won / games_played * 100)
- `average_marks_per_game`: Average marks per game

**Question Statistics:**
- `questions_answered`: Total questions answered in games
- `correct_answers`: Total correct answers given
- `answer_accuracy`: Calculated percentage (correct_answers / questions_answered * 100)

**Achievements & Streaks:**
- `current_win_streak`: Current consecutive wins
- `longest_win_streak`: Longest win streak achieved
- `last_game_played`: Timestamp of last game participation
- `last_game_result`: 'won' or 'lost'

**Automatic Updates:**
- Statistics are automatically updated when games are completed
- Question statistics are updated when losing players submit answers
- Win streaks are maintained and updated based on game outcomes

## Example Game Flow

### Player-Centric Game Workflow (Recommended)

1. **Frontend creates a game with participant count:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/games/create/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "participant_count": 4
  }'
```

Response contains match_id: `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`

2. **Frontend distributes match_id to all players**

3. **Each player submits their individual result:**

**Alice (Winner) submits:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/games/submit-completed/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "match_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "player_id": 1,
    "username": "alice",
    "player_name": "Alice",
    "team": 1,
    "marks_earned": 1,
    "is_winner": true,
    "lost_card": null,
    "question_answered": false,
    "answer_correct": false
  }'
```

**Bob (Loser) submits:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/games/submit-completed/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "match_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "player_id": 2,
    "username": "bob",
    "player_name": "Bob",
    "team": 2,
    "marks_earned": 0,
    "is_winner": false,
    "lost_card": "S3",
    "question_answered": false,
    "answer_correct": false
  }'
```

4. **Each player gets their specific response:**

**Alice gets fun fact:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/games/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000/responses/?player_id=1"
```

**Bob gets question:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/games/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000/responses/?player_id=2"
```

5. **Losing players submit answers:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/games/submit-answer/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "match_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "player_id": 2,
    "username": "bob",
    "answer": "Spades"
  }'
```

6. **Continue with UI Answer Validation Workflow (Optional):**

For more advanced UI interactions, losing players can also use:
- `/api/games/award-points/` for correct answers
- `/api/games/record-wrong-answer/` for incorrect answers

### Legacy Complete Game Workflow

For backward compatibility, the system still supports submitting complete game data all at once:

1. **Create a 2-player game:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/games/create/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "participant_count": 2,
    "players": [
        {
            "player_id": 1,
            "team": 1
        },
        {
            "player_id": 2,
            "team": 2
        }
    ]
  }'
```

2. **Complete the game (Alice wins):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/games/complete/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "match_id": "YOUR_MATCH_ID",
    "winning_team": 1,
    "cards_chosen": ["HJ", "S3"]
  }'
```

3. **Get responses:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/games/YOUR_MATCH_ID/responses/
```

4. **Bob's UI validates his answer and awards points (if correct):**
```bash
# If answer is correct:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/games/award-points/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "match_id": "YOUR_MATCH_ID",
    "username": "bob",
    "question_id": 1,
    "answer": "Kigali",
    "points": 1
  }'

# If answer is wrong:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/games/record-wrong-answer/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "match_id": "YOUR_MATCH_ID",
    "username": "bob",
    "question_id": 1,
    "answer": "Bujumbura"
  }'
```

5. **Check Alice's statistics:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/players/alice/stats/
```

6. **View leaderboard by win rate:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/leaderboard/?metric=win_rate&limit=5"
```
