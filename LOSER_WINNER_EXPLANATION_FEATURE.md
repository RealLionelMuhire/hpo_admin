# Loser/Winner Explanation Feature Documentation

## Overview
This feature ensures that both winners and losers receive educational explanations regardless of their answer correctness, promoting learning in all scenarios.

## Feature Description
> **"If a loser fails a question, he will also post that he did not pass the question (no marks awarded), and will receive a response filled with explanation from the question he lost, and as well as the winner will receive the explanation after he sends that awarded mark."**

## Implementation

### For Winners üèÜ
- **Automatic Process**: When winners submit their result via `/api/games/submit-completed/`
- **Response**: Automatically receive 1 mark + **random educational explanation from question database**
- **Educational Value**: Winners get random educational content from any question for learning
- **No Action Required**: Frontend doesn't need additional calls

### For Losers (Question Answerers) üìö

#### Correct Answer Flow ‚úÖ
1. Loser receives question from `/api/games/submit-completed/`
2. Frontend validates answer against `correct_answer` field
3. **If correct**: Frontend calls `/api/games/award-points/`
4. **Backend response**: 1 mark awarded + explanation returned

#### Wrong Answer Flow ‚ùå
1. Loser receives question from `/api/games/submit-completed/`
2. Frontend validates answer against `correct_answer` field
3. **If incorrect**: Frontend calls `/api/games/record-wrong-answer/`
4. **Backend response**: 0 marks awarded + explanation returned for learning
